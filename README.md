## Rules
This is a 1v1 player game. Player one controls the fox, player two controls the four geese.  
The starting grid consists of 4 geese at the top of the board (all on black squares),  
and one fox at the bottom of the board (also on a black square).  

The objective of the fox is to cross to the top row of the board, without being trapped by  
the 4 geese.

The fox is trapped once it has no valid moves left.   
The objective of the 4 geese is to trap and prevent a valid move from the fox player.
