# Android-Fox-and-Geese
This Android game was an assignment during my Master studies classes.

## Rules
This is a 1v1 player game. Player one controls the fox, player two controls the four geese.
The starting grid consists of 4 geese at the top of the board (all on black squares),
and one fox at the bottom of the board (also on a black square).
The objective of the fox is to cross to the top row of the board, without being trapped by
the 4 geese. The fox is trapped once it has no valid moves left. 
The objective of the 4 geese is to trap and unable a valid move from the fox player.

## Movement
The fox can move diagonally in all directions.
The geese can move diagonally only downwards.
